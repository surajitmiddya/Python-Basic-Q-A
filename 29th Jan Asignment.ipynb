    "Ans: Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is not compiled into machine code like in a compiled language such as C or C++. Instead, Python code is interpreted by the Python interpreter line by line, converting each line of code into executable code as it is encountered. This makes Python code easier to write and debug, as well as more flexible, but it can also make it slower than compiled languages for certain tasks. However, Python does have just-in-time (JIT) compilers, such as PyPy, which can improve performance for certain workloads."

    "Ans: In Python, there are several code blocks that are commonly used to define the structure and behavior of programs. These include:\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Conditional blocks: These are used to define branches of code that are executed only if a certain condition is met. In Python, the \"if\", \"elif\", and \"else\" keywords are used to define conditional blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Looping blocks: These are used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times, or until a certain condition is met. In Python, the \"for\" and \"while\" keywords are used to define looping blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Class blocks: These are used to define custom data types and their associated behavior. Classes are defined using the \"class\" keyword, followed by the class name and any necessary methods and attributes.\n",

    "5) Exception blocks: These are used to handle errors and unexpected conditions that may occur during program execution. In Python, the \"try\", \"except\", and \"finally\" keywords are used to define exception blocks"
